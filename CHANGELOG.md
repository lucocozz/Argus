## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - Initial Public Release

This marks the first stable release of Argus, a modern C library for command-line argument parsing. After extensive development and testing, we're excited to offer developers a declarative, type-safe alternative to traditional argument parsing libraries.

**Key Benefits:**
- üéØ **Type Safety**: Strong typing with automatic validation
- üöÄ **Performance**: Fast parsing with minimal memory footprint  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API that reduces boilerplate
- üìö **Comprehensive**: Supports all common CLI patterns and more
- üîß **Extensible**: Custom handlers and validators for specific needs

The library is production-ready and includes comprehensive documentation, examples, and automated testing across multiple platforms.
